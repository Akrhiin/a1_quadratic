Program #a1

Short description:
The program can calculate possible roots that appear in 
A quadratic equation by prompting user to enter three
real numbers that represent the coefficients (A, B, and C):
    Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0   or 3x^2 - 6x + 9 = 0 and A=3, B= -6, and C=9


Files included:
README.txt - this file
root.cpp   - a start to the source code for the root finding program
	     this is NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME, that is, it needs love :)
